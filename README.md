# Notes
It is app for notes

This app will help you store your notes. On the main view, you can see all the notes you have ever added. All notes are ordered by the date they have were changed.
If you want to add a new note, click on the round button at the bottom of the view. You will see a blank view where you can write the text you need. Also, if necessary, you can make edits to the text style: make it bold, italicized or underlined. You can save a note by simply pressing the back button at the top of the view.
If you need to edit the created note, just click on it and a wiew for editing will open. You need to hold the selected note for a long time to delete it. 

I hope the app will be convenient and useful for you.

The ability to insert pictures into a note will be added soon.
